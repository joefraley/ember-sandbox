And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically`

    artist: 'Eminem',
    lyrics: `I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
    I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

    lyrics: `You live life on an everyday basis
    With poetic justice, poetic justice

    You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen`
